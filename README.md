MADE BY SUGO  

Quark is a robot that is based on computer vision, which is a great tool to understand the world 
Anyways, there were a lot of different models that can perform for Quark, and i decided for object detection because it was the most useful.
In these first lines i wanna thank to Ultralytics, my job woulnt be possible without you.

Quark bases on YoloV5n model, which is an object detection model with a high perormance. I had different problems by making this with the model, and thats why its so modified. 
Quark uses a ESP32 Wrover Cam to capture images, which are requested for an ESP32S3 Dev N8R8, which proceses the image though the mentioned model, and with the results and a custom machine learning model, moves 3 servomotors.
The list of materials, 3D models, and the step by step guide are below and adjunted to the repository. If they are not, it may be because im still making my best for offering the best experience for you.
